# This will print the first item in the list)

# Writing first 5 posts to a JSON file

with open("output.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(a[:5], f, indent=4)  # Dump first 5 posts into the file with indentation of 4 spaces
    print("First 5 posts have been written to output.json")


# what is f?
# f is a file object that is used to write data to the file posts.json
# json.dump() method is used to write JSON data to a file
# indent parameter is used to format the JSON data with indentation for better readability

# what is indent=4?
# indent=4 means that each level of the JSON data will be indented by 4 spaces
# This makes the JSON data more readable when you open the file

# List is a collection of items that are ordered and changeable. 
# In this case, the list contains multiple dictionaries.
# each representing a post with keys like 'userId', 'id', 'title', and 'body'.
